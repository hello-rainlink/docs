## VI. YOUR RIGHTS AND CONTROLLING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

**Your choice:** By providing personal information to us, you understand we will collect, hold, use, and disclose your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You may choose to reject cookies and certain other tracking technologies by changing the setting of your browser. You do not have to provide personal information to us, however, if you do not, it may affect your use of our Platform or the products and/or services offered on or through it. You may also request details of the personal information that we hold about you.

**Information from third parties:** If we receive personal information about you from a third party, we will protect it as set out in this Privacy Policy. If you are a third party providing personal information about somebody else, you represent and warrant that you have such person’s consent to provide the personal information to us.

**Marketing permission and Unsubscribing:** If you have previously agreed to us using your personal information for direct marketing purposes, you may change your mind at any time by opting out of the promotional communications or contacting us using the details below. To unsubscribe from our email database or opt-out of communications (including marketing communications), please contact us using the details provided in this privacy policy or opt-out using the opt-out facilities provided in the communication. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity.

**Correction:** If you believe that any information we hold about you is inaccurate, out of date, incomplete, irrelevant, or misleading, please contact us using the details provided in this privacy policy. We will take reasonable steps to correct any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, misleading, or out of date.

**Non-discrimination:** We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights over your personal information. Unless your personal information is required to provide you with a particular service or offer (for example providing user support), we will not deny you goods or services and/or charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties, or provide you with a different level or quality of goods or services.

You also have the right to contact a regulatory body or data protection authority in relation to your complaint.

**No fee usually required:** You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

**Period for replying to a legitimate request:** We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

Notwithstanding the above, we cannot edit or delete any information that is stored on a blockchain as we do not have custody or control over any blockchains. The information stored on the blockchain may include purchases, sales, and transfers related to any blockchain address associated with you.

## VII. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY

The Platform is not directed to children under 18 (or other age as required by local law), and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has uploaded personal information to our Platform without your consent, you may contact us. If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal information in violation of applicable law, we will delete any personal information we have collected, unless we have a legal obligation to keep it, and terminate the child’s account if applicable.

## VIII. BUSINESS TRANSFERS

If we or our assets are acquired, or in the unlikely event that we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, we would include data, including your personal information, among the assets transferred to any parties who acquire us. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any parties who acquire us may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, continue to use your personal information according to this Privacy Policy, which they will be required to assume as it is the basis for any ownership or use rights we have over such information.

All information processed by us may be transferred, processed, and stored anywhere in the world, including, but not limited to, the United States, members of the European Union, or other countries, which may have data protection laws that are different from the laws where you live.
