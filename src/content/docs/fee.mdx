# Service Fee Policy

RainLink is committed to providing efficient and secure cross-chain bridge services. In order to support system operation, network relay, security audit and infrastructure maintenance, we charge a moderate service fee (Service Fee) for each cross-chain operation. This document details the composition, applicable rules and related instructions of the service fee.

## What is the service fee?

The service fee is a fixed or proportional fee charged by RainLink to users in the process of completing cross-chain asset transfers, which is independent of the gas cost of the blockchain itself. The fee is used to:

- Pay for relay node operation and maintenance costs;
- Cover off-chain communication server resource consumption;
- Fund continuous security audits and system upgrades;
- Provide user support and transaction tracking services.


## Difference between service fee and transaction fee

Users usually pay two parts when using RainLink:

```math
Bridge Fee = Transaction Fee + Service Fee
```

<Callout type="info">
**Transaction Fee**: Gas fee paid by users for on-chain transactions, such as transaction packaging fees on Ethereum. \
**Service Fee**: Cross-chain service cost charged by RainLink, see below for specific standards.

## Service Fee Billing Rules

RainLink's service fee adopts a model of coexistence of proportional and minimum fees to ensure that the fees are fair and cover basic operating costs:

## Transparency of Fee Usage

We promise that the service fees collected by RainLink will be mainly used for the following purposes:

- **Infrastructure stability maintenance**: such as communicator servers and on-chain contract monitoring systems;

- **Security upgrades and vulnerability fixes**: Ensure the anti-attack capability of user assets during cross-chain processes.
