# Bridging the Multi-Chain World

In today’s rapidly evolving blockchain space, information silos between chains remain a major barrier in the Web3 world. RainLink was born in this context, powered by the [Xone Chain](https://xone.org/) protocol—a cross-chain bridge system designed to break down these barriers and enable assets to flow freely and securely across different blockchains.

## How does RainLink work?

Think of RainLink as a “highway” connecting different chains—but smarter and more secure. It operates through three key roles:

1. **Custodian**
   User assets are first deposited into a smart contract on the source chain (e.g., Ethereum). These assets are “locked” during the cross-chain process to ensure they can’t be misused or lost.

2. **Debt Issuer**
   Once assets are locked, RainLink issues equivalent tokens (e.g., acETH) on the destination chain. These represent the user’s assets and can be used like regular tokens.

3. **Communicator**
   This is the “dispatcher” behind the scenes. It runs off-chain, listening for events on the source chain and relaying key information to the destination chain.

## A simple cross-chain process looks like this:

- User deposits ETH into an Ethereum smart contract.
- The system signals, “Asset received.”
- The Communicator picks up the signal and alerts the destination chain.
- The Debt Issuer mints acETH for the user and sends it.

To “bring the funds back,” users simply burn the acETH, and the ETH on Ethereum is automatically released.

## Fees and Security: How does RainLink handle them?

Cross-chain operations can be complex, but RainLink tackles these challenges head-on:

- **Transaction Costs**: Users pay gas fees on both the source and destination chains, plus a small service fee in some cases.
- **Security Verification**: The Communicator doesn’t send signals lightly—it confirms that transactions happened and received enough block confirmations, ensuring every move is backed by blockchain consensus.

## Why choose RainLink?

Compared to other basic cross-chain solutions, RainLink is like an “engineer-turned-designer”—precise yet user-friendly:

- Clear architecture with no redundancy
- Preserves on-chain asset integrity and prevents double-spending
- Fully decentralized and verifiable process

RainLink acts as a “multilingual translator” and “value transporter” for the blockchain world, letting you move freely and securely across Ethereum, BSC, Solana, and more—with confidence and efficiency.
