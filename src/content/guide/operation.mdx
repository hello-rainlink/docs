# RainLink Workflow

Cross-chain bridge technology enables asset transfers between different blockchains. Below is an in-depth look at its core components and workflow.

## Key Components

A cross-chain bridge consists of three main parts:

### Custodian

- Locks the user’s deposited assets.  
- Deployed on the source chain (e.g., Ethereum) via a smart contract.

### Debt Issuer

- Mints corresponding tokens on the target chain.  
- Implemented on the target chain as a smart contract.

### Communicator

- Relays messages between chains.  
- Runs off-chain, continuously monitoring source-chain events and forwarding them to the target chain.

## Workflow

<Callout type="info">

1. The user invokes a contract call to deposit ETH into the custodian on Ethereum.  
2. The custodian smart contract emits an event confirming receipt.  
3. The communicator detects this event and sends a signal to the debt issuer on the target chain.  
4. The debt issuer mints the wrapped token (`acETH`) and transfers it to the user’s address, completing the cross-chain transfer.

</Callout>

To reverse the process:

<Callout type="info">

1. The user burns `acETH` via the debt issuer on the target chain.  
2. Once the burn is confirmed, the debt issuer emits a redemption event.  
3. The communicator picks up this event and notifies the custodian on the source chain.  
4. The custodian releases the original ETH back to the user’s address.

</Callout>

## Fees & Security Checks

When bridging assets, two factors are crucial: fees and validity verification.

### Fees

Users typically pay:

```math
Bridge Fee = Transaction Fee + Service Fee
```

1. Transaction Fee: Gas costs on the source and/or target blockchain (e.g., Ethereum gas).

2. Service Fee: Charged by the bridge provider. See [Bridge Fee Schedule](/docs/fee) for details.

### Validity Verification

The communicator ensures security by:

1. Executing the lock or burn on the source chain.

2. Waiting for a sufficient number of confirmations to guarantee finality.

3. Relaying the event only after confirmation, ensuring the cross-chain transfer is both safe and valid.
