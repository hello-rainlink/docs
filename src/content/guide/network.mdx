## Network Selection Guide

Before initiating cross-chain operations, users need to pay attention to the following points:

- **Wallet compatibility**: Make sure the wallet you use supports the source and target chains you choose (recommended to use multi-chain compatible wallets such as [OKX Wallet](https://www.okx.com/web3/wallet) and [TokenUp](https://www.tokenup.org/));

- **Gas reservation**: The Gas cost required for each network is different. It is recommended to reserve a small amount of native tokens (such as ETH, BNB, TRX, XOC...) in the source and target chains respectively;

- **Asset standard differences**: Assets with the same name (such as USDT) on different chains may have different contract addresses. Please be sure to refer to the version supported by the [RainLink page](https://docs.xone.org/developers/token).
